Update the Next.js app (app router) to a single-page minimalist landing called "SearchAI" and apply the exact copy & layout changes below. Use Tailwind classes where possible and small custom CSS for the subtle visual effects. Update/create the following files and behaviors:

GOAL COPY (use exactly):
- Main heading (split on two lines):
  Line 1: "Creating a one-of-a-kind experience"
  Line 2: "For your mind"
- Sub-heading: "Reflect. Grow. Understand yourself deeper."
- Email placeholder: "Enter your email"
- Small line directly under the email input: "Limited early access. By invitation only."
- Footer small line: "Built by thinkers, for thinkers."

SEO META (place in app/layout.tsx metadata or <Head>):
<title>SearchAI Reflect, Grow, and Understand Yourself Deeper</title>
<meta name="description" content="SearchAI helps you explore your thoughts through guided conversations. Join the waitlist for a one-of-a-kind introspective AI experience.">
<meta name="keywords" content="self reflection app, personal growth ai, ai journaling, self awareness tool, ai mental wellness, Ai assisted thinking app, mindful conversation app">

FILES TO UPDATE / CREATE:
1) app/layout.tsx
 - Add site-level metadata above.
 - Ensure global styling import (styles/globals.css or ./globals.css).
 - Keep the page language and basic body class (bg-black, text colors).

2) app/page.tsx
 - Replace current hero with centered hero using the **exact** copy above.
 - Heading should be large, split into two lines. "For your mind" should use a slightly muted gray color (#A0A0A0) vs the main white headline.
 - Below the heading place the short sub-heading.
 - Add an email Waitlist component (components/WaitlistForm) with:
   - rounded input field with placeholder "Enter your email"
   - large rounded "Join the Waitlist" button
   - a small text line under the input that reads: "Limited early access. By invitation only."
 - Ensure the hero and form are vertically centered and responsive (max-width ~700px for text).
 - Add a subtle absolute background overlay (radial glow) that reacts to mouse movement using CSS variables (JS sets --mx and --my).
 - All hero elements should have gentle entrance transitions (fade + small translate Y).

3) app/components/WaitlistForm.tsx
 - Implement as a client component (use client).
 - Basic validation for email; on success show temporary success state (message) and store locally for demo (localStorage).
 - Render the "Limited early access. By invitation only." line directly beneath the input (slightly muted).
 - Add accessible aria attributes.

4) app/components/Header.tsx (or put header in page.tsx)
 - Navbar layout: left side show the logo (circular mark with initial or small brand wordmark).
 - Right side show: socials icons (X, Instagram, Reddit/other) **then** the contact email text (clickable mailto: contact@searchai.example or use the email you provided in the image — if the codebase has a specific contact email, use that).
 - Make social icons small, monochrome, with hover opacity and tiny upward motion on hover.
 - Make contact email text muted but visible and clickable (mailto).

5) styles/globals.css (or update existing)
 - Add Inter font import.
 - Define CSS variables:
    --bg: #000000
    --text: #F1F1F1
    --muted: #A0A0A0
 - Add .bg-radial-glow that uses radial-gradient driven by --mx/--my for subtle parallax glow.
 - Add helper classes for fade-in-up animation, focus glow on inputs, and smooth transition utility classes.
 - Ensure accessible focus outline for keyboard navigation.

ANIMATIONS & INTERACTIVITY (subtle):
 - Hero text & subheading: fade-in + translateY on load (staggered).
 - Input: outline-glow on focus (soft white ring).
 - Button: soft glow & slight scale on hover; smooth transition (0.25–0.4s).
 - Social icons: small lift & opacity on hover.
 - Background: radial glow reacts to mouse movement using CSS vars updated in page.tsx (small movement only).
 - Entrance transitions: 600–800ms, easing cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.2,1), stagger delays for headline, subheading, form.
 - Keep everything calm — no flashing or heavy motion.

ACCESSIBILITY & RESPONSIVENESS:
 - Use semantic elements (header, main, footer).
 - Inputs must have labels / aria-labels.
 - Ensure readable font sizes on mobile and desktop (use responsive text sizes).
 - Make layout stack vertically on small screens with appropriate spacing.

EXTRA NOTES:
 - If Tailwind is used in the repo, keep Tailwind classes; if not, provide plain CSS fallback.
 - If you use Framer Motion for smoother sequence animations, include a note to install: `npm i framer-motion` and use it only if present. Otherwise use CSS animations.
 - Keep changes localized to: app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, components/WaitlistForm.tsx, components/Header.tsx (optional), styles/globals.css. Keep other files unchanged.

OUTPUT:
 - Return the full modified files (app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, components/WaitlistForm.tsx, components/Header.tsx if created, styles/globals.css).
 - If additional packages are required (framer-motion), include install commands and where it's used.

Behavior example summary:
 - Navbar: [ Logo (left) ] — spacer — [ Social icons | contact@searchai.example (right) ]
 - Hero: Large two-line heading:
      Creating a one-of-a-kind experience
      For your mind
   Sub-heading: Reflect. Grow. Understand yourself deeper.
   Email input (Enter your email)
   Join the Waitlist (button)
   Small muted line under input: Limited early access. By invitation only.
 - Footer: small copyright + "Built by thinkers, for thinkers."

Make sure all texts match the copy above exactly, and that the layout and subtle interactive transitions follow the calm, minimal style already in the design.
