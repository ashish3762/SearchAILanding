# SearchAI - Next.js Project

## Overview
SearchAI is a Next.js 16 application that helps users discover self-awareness through guided questions. The app features a waitlist signup integrated with Google Apps Script, comprehensive SEO-optimized pages, and a blog section with dynamic routing.

**Current State:** Successfully migrated from Vercel to Replit, expanded with SEO pages and blog functionality, enhanced with Google site verification, favicon, social media integration, and fully functional dynamic blog routing. Running without errors.

## Recent Changes (October 31, 2025)

### SEO & Social Media Enhancements
- **Google Site Verification**: Added Google site verification meta tag in metadata export for Search Console verification
- **Favicon**: Added custom favicon to public folder and integrated via Next.js metadata icons API
- **Social Media Footer**: Added horizontal social media icon links to footer for X (Twitter), Reddit, Instagram, and Threads with hover effects matching dark theme
- **Hero Cleanup**: Removed duplicate "SearchAI" logo from landing page hero section (kept only in navigation)
- **Blog Routing Fix**: Updated dynamic blog routing to work with Next.js 15+ async params pattern for `/blogs/[slug]` routes
- **DotGrid Bug Fix**: Fixed null reference error in DotGrid component by adding proper null checks before accessing canvasRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()

## Previous Changes (October 30, 2025)

### SEO Pages & Blog Expansion
- **New Pages**: Added About, Contact, Services, Blogs (listing), and dynamic blog posts at `/blogs/[slug]`
- **Navigation Component**: Created responsive navigation with desktop/mobile views and active link highlighting
- **Blog System**: Implemented blog data structure in `lib/blogs.ts` with mock posts for development
- **Contact Form**: Built functional contact form component with client-side validation
- **SEO Optimization**: All pages include comprehensive metadata with Open Graph tags for social sharing
- **Design Consistency**: All new pages follow the existing minimal dark theme design pattern
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper labels, and responsive Tailwind CSS classes throughout

### Vercel to Replit Migration
- **Security Enhancement**: Moved hardcoded Google Apps Script URL to environment variable (`GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL`)
- **Port Configuration**: Updated dev and start scripts to bind to port 5000 on 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility
- **Deployment Setup**: Configured autoscale deployment with proper build and start commands
- **Dependencies**: Installed all packages via pnpm
- **Known Warning**: Next.js displays a cross-origin warning for Replit's proxy environment. This is a future notice and doesn't affect functionality in Next.js 16.0.0.

### Key Features
1. **Landing Page**: Hero section with tagline and waitlist form
2. **Waitlist API**: Server-side endpoint that validates emails and forwards to Google Apps Script
3. **About Page**: Company mission and vision with SEO metadata
4. **Services Page**: Three core service offerings displayed in card layout
5. **Contact Page**: Functional contact form with email validation
6. **Blog System**: 
   - Blog listing page showing all posts with images and descriptions
   - Dynamic routing for individual blog posts at `/blogs/[slug]`
   - Static generation support with `generateStaticParams`
   - Full SEO metadata including Open Graph for social sharing
7. **Responsive Navigation**: Desktop and mobile-friendly menu with active state highlighting
8. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS throughout all pages

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL`: The Google Apps Script webhook URL for waitlist submissions (required for waitlist functionality)

### Development
- Server runs on port 5000 with host 0.0.0.0
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled
- Vercel Analytics in debug mode (no data sent in development)

### Production Notes
- **TypeScript**: Build errors are currently ignored (`ignoreBuildErrors: true`). This setting was present in the original Vercel configuration and has been preserved during migration. Before deploying to production, you should:
  1. Run `pnpm run build` to identify any TypeScript errors
  2. Fix all type errors or consciously decide to proceed with this setting
  3. Consider enabling strict type checking by removing `ignoreBuildErrors: true`
- **Images**: Image optimization is disabled (`unoptimized: true`). This setting was present in the original configuration. For production, consider:
  1. Enabling Next.js image optimization by removing `unoptimized: true`
  2. Or keeping it disabled if you serve optimized images from a CDN
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` is set in Replit Secrets for both development and production deployments
- **Deployment Verification**: Test the waitlist submission feature after deployment to ensure the Google Apps Script integration works correctly

## Deployment

### Replit Deployment Configuration
- **Type**: Autoscale (stateless web application)
- **Build Command**: `pnpm run build`
- **Start Command**: `pnpm run start`
- **Port**: 5000

### Publishing Checklist
1. Verify `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` is set in deployment secrets
2. Test waitlist submission functionality
3. Review TypeScript errors (currently suppressed)
4. Consider enabling image optimization for better performance

## Security Best Practices
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ Environment variables used for sensitive URLs
- ✅ Server-side API validation (email format check)
- ✅ Error logging without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## User Preferences
None documented yet.

## Known Issues & Considerations
1. **TypeScript Build Errors**: Currently ignored. Review and fix before production.
2. **Image Optimization**: Disabled. May want to enable for production performance.
3. **Waitlist Error Handling**: API returns 500 if `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` is missing. Consider adding startup validation.

## Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server (port 5000)
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
